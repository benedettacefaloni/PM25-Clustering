# Roadmap for the Project

## Data Preparation

- [Done] Decide on year
- [Done] Filter NaN values out
- [Done] Document the loss of data and why the specific year was chosen 
- [Done] Integrate week number into the columns
- [Done] Save filtered and cleaned data as a new table
- [Done] Standardize data for the covariates
- [Done] Missing values in the covariates
    - [Done] numerical values
    â€” [Done] categorical values
- Integrate into data loader to easily filter the data by week
    - write subfunctions to provide data for sppm (weekly) and drpm (full time-series,
    reshape to n_stations, time with increasing values)
- Document the aggregation
- Add the documentation part into the section "Data Preparation
    and Initial Data Analysis" of the report
- Upload the the code which created the aggregation onto Github

Backlog:
- Fix issue with week numbers in year 2021
- Give some explorative data analysis:
    - variance, mean, distribution of pm2.5 values
    - include correlation analysis

### Optional
- Repeat with another year (maybe a covid year) so we can later on work on a comparison

## Coding
- Decide on evaluation criteria
    - [Done] MSE on the prediction values (lower is better)
    - [Done] WAIC lower/higher better?
    - [Done] LPML lower/higher better?
    - [DONE] number of cluster overall
    - [DONE] sizes of clusters
        - number of singleton clusters
        - min, max, avg, median size
    - [Done] Error in the drpm model:
        - [Done] results and evaluation
    - [Done] error in gaussian_ppmx --> covariates
    - [Done] covariate transformation
    - [Done] clean up the main file
    - Manual checking
        - [Done] Plot clusters with a map
        - Switching of a single station

- [Done] General framework for automatic evaluation
- include new data and unify all the folders


Backlog:
- Evaluation Criteria:
    - [Done] max. distance between two stations in the same cluster, max difference
        of pm2.5 values inside a cluster
    - [Done] Plot the number of clusters for different models over time in a grid-wise fashion
    each value in different plot with all models (e.g. 2x3 grid)
    - [Done] Finish evaluation: table creation
- Evaluation:
    - test different models
    - plot and analyze results
    - tune prior params

- Prior parameter choice?
    - SPPM:
        - M: different values 5*10e-3, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0
        - m = 0, s2 = 10^2, B = 10, A = 10 (page 27 in the reader)
        - C1:
            - alpha: 1.0 and 2.0
        - C2:
            - median distance of all pairwise distances (p. 9 in the reader)
        - C3 and C4:
            - mu0 - center of NNIG for cohesion 3 and 4
            - k0 - scale parm of gaussian part of NNIG for cohesion 3 and 4
            - v0 - degrees of freedom IG part of NNIG for cohesion 3 and 4
            - L0 - scale parm (scalar of identity matrix) IG part of NNIG for cohesion 3 and 4
    - ppmx
        - v is the kappa since we standardized the Covariates
        - (m0 = 0, k0 = 1.0, v0 = 10.0, n0 = 2)
        - and the second (m0 = 0, k0 = 1.0,v0 = 1.0, n0 = 2)
    - tRPM:
        - A_sigma = 5 or 0.5*sd(Yvec) (temporally independent CRP and temporally static CRP) or 1 (Space-time data generation) or 15 (2 to account for the higher variability present in the data)
        - A_tau = 10 or 100  (temporally independent CRP and temporally static CRP) or 2 (Space-time data generation)
        - A_lambda = 10
        - m0 = 0
        - S0 = 100
        - a_alpha = b_alpha = M = 1
        - alpha(t) = alpha 
            - alpha: 1.0 and 2.0 (lead to similar results)

- [DONE] Use salso package to evaluate the clustering itself
- [Done] implement visualization model for report and sanity checks
    - [Done] plot pm2.5 concentration and clustering at the same time

### Optional
- Streamlit application for interactive visualization
    - over time
    - values for params of the models (input is a dict with prewritten values in a text field)
    - see: https://streamlit.io/ for more details, the deployment is free to host the app

## Report
- Formulate the Introduction of the slides into text (explain pm2.5, causes, etc.)
- Integrate the data exploration part (see above)
- Theory and models part
    - Mathematical formulations
    - Pros and Cons and our expectations from the models
    - Explain priors and extensions in detail
    - Paper citations

Backlog:
- Salso Package: give short insights about the models idea
- Give theoretical details about the evaluation criteria used in the report, indicate if higher/lower is better (always in brackets)
    - e.g. MSE = mean squared error (lower is better), WAIC, LPML
- Cite R packages
- Is it allowed to use pm10 as a covariate?
